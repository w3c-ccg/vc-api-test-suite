<dl class="termlist">

  <dt><dfn data-lt="decentralized identifiers|DID|DIDs">decentralized identifier</dfn> (DID)</dt>

  <dd>
A globally unique persistent identifier that does not require a centralized
registration authority and is often generated and/or registered
cryptographically. The generic format of a DID is defined in <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-syntax">DID Core: Syntax</a>. A
specific <a>DID scheme</a> is defined in a <a>DID method</a> specification.
Many—but not all—DID methods make use of <a>distributed ledger technology</a>
(DLT) or some other form of decentralized network.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="URI|URIs">Uniform Resource Identifier</dfn> (URI)</dt>

  <dd>
The standard identifier format for all resources on the World Wide Web as
defined by [[RFC3986]]. A <a>DID</a> is a type of URI scheme.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="verifiable credentials">verifiable credential</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
A standard data model and representation format for cryptographically-verifiable
digital credentials as defined by the W3C Verifiable Credentials specification
[[VC-DATA-MODEL]].
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="UUID|UUIDs">Universally Unique Identifier</dfn> (UUID)</dt>

  <dd>
A type of globally unique identifier defined by [[RFC4122]]. UUIDs are similar
to DIDs in that they do not require a centralized registration authority. UUIDs
differ from DIDs in that they are not resolvable or
cryptographically-verifiable.
